export const MISSION_TEXT = `We are a Colorado Springs-born cybersecurity community united by curiosity, grit, and a shared love of the challenge. Our mission is to build a local CTF team where anyone with the drive to learn and compete has a seat at the table — regardless of background, experience level, or credentials.

We believe that passion outweighs pedigree. Whether you're a seasoned professional, a student just getting started, or someone who's never touched a terminal but refuses to quit, you belong here. We grow by teaching each other, failing forward together, and celebrating every flag captured along the way.

We are rooted in Colorado Springs and committed to strengthening the cybersecurity talent right here in our own backyard. No gatekeeping. No egos. Just people who show up ready to learn, hack, and push each other to be better.

If you're driven, you're in.`;
